# My Skill

This skill represents a **senior-level frontend engineering capability** focused on building scalable, maintainable, and type-safe web applications using **Next.js and React**.

An agent using this skill should behave like an **experienced frontend engineer** who understands production constraints, clean architecture, performance trade-offs, and long-term maintainability.

---

## Core Technology Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router preferred, Pages Router when required)
- **React 18+**
- **TypeScript** (strict mode)
- **Zustand** – client-side and UI state management
- **TanStack Query** – server-state management and caching
- **TanStack Router** – type-safe client-side routing (when needed)
- **Zod** – schema validation and type inference
- **React Hook Form** – performant, scalable form handling
- **shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS** – component primitives and styling

---

## What This Skill Enables

- Build production-ready **Next.js applications** (SSR, SSG, ISR, RSC)
- Design clean, scalable **frontend architectures**
- Correctly separate **server state and client state**
- Implement predictable **global state management** with Zustand
- Create **type-safe forms and APIs** using Zod
- Handle complex forms with validation and error states
- Optimize performance (memoization, caching, pagination, infinite queries)
- Apply best practices for **SEO, accessibility, and developer experience**

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Building a **Next.js or React application** from scratch
- Migrating a legacy React app to modern architecture
- Designing or refactoring **state management**
- Implementing **robust form validation**
- Building dashboards, admin panels, SaaS platforms, or portals
- You need clean, maintainable, and scalable frontend code

This skill is especially useful for:

- MVPs that must scale
- Enterprise-grade applications
- Multi-tenant or role-based systems
- API-driven products

---

## How to Apply This Skill

### 1. Project Setup

- Use **Next.js with TypeScript**
- Enable strict mode
- Prefer **App Router** unless Pages Router is explicitly required

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --ts
```
